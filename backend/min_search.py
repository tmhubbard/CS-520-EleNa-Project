    Minimizes elevation gain within constraint of x% of the shortest path by

    Parameters:
    -----------
    graph: NetworkX MultiDiGraph
        The graph to perform the search on.
    source: int
        The node id of the source point.
    target: int

    percent_shortest_path: float (> 1.0)
        The constraint of the maximum distance allowed, represented as a

    iterations: int
        The maximum number of iterations of the binary search to perform, at
