    Given a path as a list of nodes, and the weight to maximize, finds the

    convieniece this function returns the length and elevation gain found along

    Parameters:

    path_length: float
        The total distance along every edge found
    path_ele_gain: float
        The total elevation gain along every edge found

"""
Given a graph, networkx will generate the shortest path P from source to target based on length.
It will then loop over the nodes P, and for each node it will  create a list L of all paths 
from P_n to P_n+1 with some cutoff depth. 
The graph handed to nx.all_simple_paths will have had all nodes P_0 through P_n-1 removed [IMPORTANT].
It loops over L to find the path that has the properties:
    1. ele_gain >= 0
    2. length(P_0 -> P_n) + length(L[i]) + length(P_n+1 -> P_k)
    3. L[i] has highest ele_gain in L

Upon finding this path P_new, it will be inserted between P_n and P_n+1
